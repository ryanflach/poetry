# Still I Rise

## Verse 1
You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

## Verse 2
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells

## Verse 3
Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

### Verse 4

The free bird thinks of another breeze
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawn
and he names the sky his own.

### Verse 5

But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing

### Verse 6

The caged bird sings
with a fearful trill
of things unknown
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill
for the caged bird
sings of freedom.
